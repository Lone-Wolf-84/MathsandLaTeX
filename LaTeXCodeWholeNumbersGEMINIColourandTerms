\section{\textcolor{blue}{Introduction}}

This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of whole numbers, including \textcolor{red}{rounding}, \textcolor{red}{place value}, and \textcolor{red}{estimation}. These skills are fundamental in mathematics and are frequently used in everyday life.

\section{\textcolor{blue}{Place Value}}

\subsection{\textcolor{purple}{Understanding Place Value}}

\textcolor{red}{Place value} refers to the value of a digit based on its position in a number. For example, in the number 1\,234, the digit 1 represents 1\,000, 2 represents 200, 3 represents 30, and 4 represents 4.

\subsection{\textcolor{green}{Example}}

Consider the number 567\,890.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 5 is in the hundred thousands place, so it has a value of 500\,000
    \item 6 is in the ten thousands place, so it has a value of 60\,000
    \item 7 is in the thousands place, so it has a value of 7\,000
    \item 8 is in the hundreds place, so it has a value of 800
    \item 9 is in the tens place, so it has a value of 90
    \item 0 is in the ones place, so it has a value of 0
\end{itemize}

\section{\textcolor{blue}{Rounding Numbers}}

\subsection{\textcolor{purple}{Rounding Rules}}

\textcolor{red}{Rounding} is a way to simplify numbers.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the digit to the right of the rounding place is 5 or more, round up.
    \item If the digit to the right of the rounding place is less than 5, round down.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textcolor{green}{Examples}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Round 1\,234 to the nearest hundred: 1\,200
    \item Round 5\,678 to the nearest thousand: 6\,000
    \item Round 987 to the nearest ten: 990
\end{itemize}

\section{\textcolor{blue}{Estimating}}

\subsection{\textcolor{purple}{Estimation Techniques}}

\textcolor{red}{Estimation} involves finding an approximate answer. It is useful for quick calculations and checking the reasonableness of results.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Round numbers to make calculations easier.
    \item Use compatible numbers (numbers that are easy to calculate mentally).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textcolor{green}{Example}}

Estimate the sum of 1\,234 and 5\,678.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Round 1\,234 to 1\,200.
    \item Round 5\,678 to 5\,700.
    \item Estimate: 1\,200 + 5\,700 = 6\,900
\end{itemize}

\section{\textcolor{blue}{Practical Example}}

A school is planning a trip for 348 students. Each bus can carry 45 students. Estimate how many buses are needed.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Round 348 to 350.
    \item Round 45 to 50.
    \item Estimate: 350 / 50 = 7 buses.
\end{itemize}

\section{\textcolor{blue}{Knowledge and Skills Test}}

\subsection{\textcolor{purple}{Place Value Questions}}

1.  What is the \textcolor{red}{place value} of 7 in the number 45\,789?
2.  Write the number 90\,000 + 3\,000 + 200 + 50 + 1 in standard form.

\subsection{\textcolor{purple}{Rounding Questions}}

1.  Round 12\,345 to the nearest thousand.
2.  Round 678 to the nearest hundred.

\subsection{\textcolor{purple}{Estimation Questions}}

1.  Estimate the product of 23 and 48.
2.  Estimate the quotient of 789 and 26.

\subsection{\textcolor{purple}{Practical Application}}

1.  A store sold 1\,567 items in January and 2\,345 items in February. Estimate the total number of items sold.
2.  A recipe calls for 245 grams of flour. If you need to make 3 times the recipe, estimate how much flour you will need.
