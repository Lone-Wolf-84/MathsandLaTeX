\section{Introduction}

This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of whole numbers, including rounding, place value, and estimation. These skills are fundamental in mathematics and are frequently used in everyday life.

\section{Place Value}

\subsection{Understanding Place Value}

Place value refers to the value of a digit based on its position in a number. For example, in the number 1,234, the digit 1 represents 1,000, 2 represents 200, 3 represents 30, and 4 represents 4.

\subsection{Example}

Consider the number 567,890.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 5 is in the hundred thousands place (500,000)
    \item 6 is in the ten thousands place (60,000)
    \item 7 is in the thousands place (7,000)
    \item 8 is in the hundreds place (800)
    \item 9 is in the tens place (90)
    \item 0 is in the ones place (0)
\end{itemize}

\section{Rounding Numbers}

\subsection{Rounding Rules}

Rounding is a way to simplify numbers.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the digit to the right of the rounding place is 5 or more, round up.
    \item If the digit to the right of the rounding place is less than 5, round down.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Examples}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Round 1,234 to the nearest hundred: 1,200
    \item Round 5,678 to the nearest thousand: 6,000
    \item Round 987 to the nearest ten: 990
\end{itemize}

\section{Estimating}

\subsection{Estimation Techniques}

Estimation involves finding an approximate answer. It is useful for quick calculations and checking the reasonableness of results.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Round numbers to make calculations easier.
    \item Use compatible numbers (numbers that are easy to calculate mentally).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example}

Estimate the sum of 1,234 and 5,678.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Round 1,234 to 1,200.
    \item Round 5,678 to 5,700.
    \item Estimate: 1,200 + 5,700 = 6,900
\end{itemize}

\section{Practical Example}

A school is planning a trip for 348 students. Each bus can carry 45 students. Estimate how many buses are needed.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Round 348 to 350.
    \item Round 45 to 50.
    \item Estimate: 350 / 50 = 7 buses.
\end{itemize}

\section{Knowledge and Skills Test}

\subsection{Place Value Questions}

1.  What is the place value of 7 in the number 45,789?
2.  Write the number 90,000 + 3,000 + 200 + 50 + 1 in standard form.

\subsection{Rounding Questions}

1.  Round 12,345 to the nearest thousand.
2.  Round 678 to the nearest hundred.

\subsection{Estimation Questions}

1.  Estimate the product of 23 and 48.
2.  Estimate the quotient of 789 and 26.

\subsection{Practical Application}

1.  A store sold 1,567 items in January and 2,345 items in February. Estimate the total number of items sold.
2.  A recipe calls for 245 grams of flour. If you need to make 3 times the recipe, estimate how much flour you will need.
